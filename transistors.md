Semiconductors
==============

+ Phosphorous has 5 instead of 4 valence electrons, so doping silicon with it creates an overflow of electrons -> n-type
+ Boron creates holes -> p-type


p-n Junction Diodes == Rectifier Diodes
---------------------------------------

+  +||-----[ p ][ n ]------||-
   current flow ----------->

+ When rectifier diodes are forward biased, holes in the p-typematerial are forced to the center of the diode, as well as electrons from the n-type material. This allows current to flow through the diode.

+ When reversed biased, holes and electrons flow away from the junction of the two materials, leaving a *depletion region* (and current does not flow)

+ Most silicon diodes require 0.6 V forward bias to conduct (Germanium diodes only 0.2 V)

+ (+) anode ---|>|---- cathode (-)

#### Applications
+ May be used to drop voltage, like resistors except less variable with current and more efficient thermally
+ Many more in book ...

Transistors
-----------

### Bipolar Transistors

+ Require a biasing input (or output) current at their control leads

### FET Transistors

+ Require only a voltage and practically no current at control leads
+ Because FETs draw little current, they have high input impedances and the current of the control lead will not have much influence on the current dynamics within the circuit
