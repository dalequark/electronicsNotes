Microphone Amplifiers
---------------------

+ feed a lower-impedance microphone into a higher-impedance input device
	About 10x greater impedance is good
+ Common to use op amp 
+ Use a capacitor to filter out DC offset from signal before feeding into op amp
+ Use a digital amplifier to amplify a microphone signal and convert it to PWM.
	Use along with a MOSFET
